=============================================
Git repository for an open-source Java graph library
started 11/23/2012
This library currently includes relatively lightweight
classes that avoid the overhead involved in insuring
thread-safety.
I plan to include thread-safe classes later while keeping
things as simple as possible to begin with.
Note: As of 12/5/2012 it seems to be better to deal with the complications
of various Vertex interfaces, as we have too much vertex data that
is necessary for 1 algorithm but unnecessary for others.
