=============================================
Git repository for revised Java graph library
started 11/23/2012
This library currently includes relatively lightweight
classes that avoid the overhead involved in insuring
thread-safety.
I plan to include thread-safe classes later while keeping
things as simple and lightweight as possible to begin with.
