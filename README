=============================================
Git repository for an open-source Java graph library
started 11/23/2012.
The purpose of this version is simplicity. It avoids
the complications of parameterization and of concurrency.
Since these classes are not parameterized, they have to support
the necessary fields for all implemented algorithms. So, for
example, weighted edges are supported in order to implement
Kruskal's algorithm even though depth-first search makes
no use of weighted edges. The simplicity of the classes
comes with the price that each object includes a good deal
of unused data.
